# ieducate-mern
A fully featured school management platform with roles of Student, Admin, Teachers, built using MERN

## My experience building this project

My experience with the ieducate project was both challenging and fulfilling. This project required me to use a range of technologies to create a comprehensive educational platform that catered to the needs of students, teachers, and administrators.

For the frontend, I chose to use React, Tailwind CSS, and Ant Design. These technologies allowed me to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that made it easy for users to navigate the various features of the platform. The use of React also allowed for the creation of reusable components that helped to simplify the development process.

On the backend, I used MongoDB, Express, and Node.js to create a robust and scalable system that could handle the large amounts of data that were being processed. The use of these technologies allowed for fast and reliable data retrieval and storage, while also providing flexibility and ease of maintenance.

One of the key features of the ieducate platform was the three dashboards that I created for administrators, teachers, and students. The teacher dashboard allowed teachers to create reports for their students, view their own attendance history, and update their own credentials. This feature made it easy for teachers to stay on top of their students' progress and ensure that they were meeting their academic goals.

The admin dashboard, on the other hand, allowed administrators to create, edit, and delete student, admin, and teacher accounts. Admins could also add and edit subjects, set attendance for teachers, view the fees of students, generate invoices, and create new announcements. This comprehensive set of features made it easy for administrators to manage the various aspects of the platform and ensure that everything was running smoothly.

Finally, the student dashboard allowed students to view their reports, invoices, and announcements. They could also update their own credentials as needed. This feature made it easy for students to stay on top of their academic progress and ensure that they were meeting their goals.

It also has the integration of SMTP email. Whenever an announcement or invoice was generated, an email would be sent to the student. This feature ensured that students were always kept up-to-date with the latest information and helped to reduce the risk of missed deadlines or other important information.

There are many more features in this application like Auto Logout, Assigning specific teachers to Students, Exporting Data to CSV and a lot!!

Throughout the development process, I faced a range of challenges and obstacles. However, with careful planning and problem-solving, I was able to overcome these challenges and deliver a high-quality product that met the needs of the client.

In conclusion, my experience with the ieducate project was a challenging yet fulfilling one. The use of a range of technologies, including React, Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js, allowed for the creation of a comprehensive educational platform that catered to the needs of students, teachers, and administrators. The use of SMTP email integration also helped to ensure that students were always kept up-to-date with the latest information. Overall, this project was a testament to the power of collaboration and the ability to deliver high-quality solutions that meet the needs of clients.
